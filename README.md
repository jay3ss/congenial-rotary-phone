This contains different implementations of data structures in Python. This uses
Python 3.6.7 and `pytest` for testing. So far, the data structures that have
been implemented are:

- singly-linked list
- linked-stack
- linked-queue (in development)

## Tests

### Install pytest
Make sure that you have `pytest` (4.6.2) installed. You can install it by
running (hopefully from a virtual environment)

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Running the tests

Running the tests is simple. From the root directory, just run

`pytest`
